With npm:

        $ npm install

If you have yarn:

        $ yarn

Development
---

1. Run the webpack-dev-server so the app is served up
   by a web server.

        $ npm start

2. Now you can open the app and see live changes:
   http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

Production

1. Run the non-webpack build:

        $ npm run build

*or*

1. Run the webpack build:

        $ npm run build:webpack

2. Profit by submitting dist/game.zip!
