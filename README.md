Welcome to the Minimum Viable TypeScript Webpack app!

Let's get started:

1. Install dependencies:

        $ npm install

2. Build the app once:

        $ npm run build

3. Open ./index.html

4. Modify the app in src/index.ts

5. Build it again:

        $ npm run build

6. Refresh the browser. Magic!

7. Run webpack in dev mode so it recompiles / rebundles each time the
   source changes:

        $ npm run dev

8. Now you can modify the source and refresh the browser without doing
   a build.

9. Finally, you can run the webpack-dev-server so the app is served up
   by a web server. This would allow you to do hot module replacement
   if you'd like. Google that.

        $ npm run start

10. Now you can surf to the app at: http://localhost:8080
